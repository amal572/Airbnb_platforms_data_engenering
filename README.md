# Airbnb Zoomcamp Course Project | Data Engineering

### Problem statement
The project aims to build an end-to-end data pipeline that extracts Airbnb prices in some of the most popular European cities. Each listing is evaluated for various attributes such as room types, cleanliness and satisfaction ratings, bedrooms, distance from the city center, and more to capture an in-depth understanding of Airbnb prices on both weekdays and weekends.
There will be one running pipeline (DAG):
<li> Weekly_DAG: this DAG will run weekly to extract new data starting from the installation time. </li>
